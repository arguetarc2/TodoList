# TodoList
Basic Todo List

This is a very basic todo list that can also serve as a general list. It
gives the user options to add items, list the items on the list, remove
items, or to clear the entire list. The user may then exit the initial
UI and is asked a final question about whether they would like to print
their list to an external .txt file.
